## Introduction

Argestan Gym & Dev is more than just a gym; it's a place where physical and technical development go hand in hand. This project aims to provide practical tools that can be used by gym members, staff, and developers alike. It's a demonstration of my commitment to continuous improvement and a tangible example of my coding progress.

## Features

This project currently includes the following features:

- **Real-time Clock and Date:** Displays the current date and time. Useful for scheduling and tracking workout durations.
- **Customizable Timer:** A timer that can be adjusted and used for timing workouts, rest periods, or other activities. Includes start, pause, reset, increase, and decrease functionality. Provides a visual alert (blinking background) when the timer reaches zero.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Interactive elements, timer functionality, and DOM manipulation.
- **Google Fonts:** Used for attractive typography.

## Installation
